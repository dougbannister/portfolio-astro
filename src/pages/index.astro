          Hello. I’m a designer and researcher crafting engaging digital
          experiences with a focus on users and results.

      <p>
        From conducting in-depth user research to developing high-fidelity
        prototypes or design systems in Figma, I design accessible,
        user-friendly, and delightful solutions that meet user needs and
        business objectives.

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>
      For over a decade, I’ve been immersed in design, with a focus on user
      research and prototyping. I’ve worn many hats, from leading A/B testing to
      developing complex design systems in Figma. Most days, you’ll find me
      refining user flows or finding that sweet spot between business goals and
      user needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about solving problems with empathy and simplicity. I’ve
      worked across various sectors, including travel, and have a solid
      foundation in CRO and product optimisation. Whether it's diving into
      analytics or chatting with users, my goal is always the same: <strong
        >create experiences that feel seamless and meaningful.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love tinkering with new tech and am no stranger to code. If you
      want to geek out over the latest in AI or game dev, you’ve met the right
      person.
